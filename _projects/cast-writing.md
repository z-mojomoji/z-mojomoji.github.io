# CaST Writing

## Principle Features

- clear minimalistic interface
- clear writing tooltips
- document versioning (version control)
- track changes (differences between versions)
- merging of diverging versions
- concurrent editing (similar to Google Docs)
- offline support and multi-device support
- platform independent (for Windows, Mac and Linux)
- reference management (citations)

## Workflow in Brief

Text in structured [Markdown] syntax is written in the [Atom] editor and stored in simple plain-text Markdown files. These files are versioned using [Git] and converted to the desired output format using the tool [Pandoc].
